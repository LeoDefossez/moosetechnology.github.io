title: FAST

FAST means *Famix AST*.
Contrary to Famix that represent application at a high abstraction level, FAST uses a low-level representation: the AST.

From Moose 9, and version *v2* of FAST, FAST defined a set of traits that can be used to create new meta-models compatible with Moose tools.
This strategy is similar to the [pre-defined traits of Famix](../../Developers/predefinedEntities).
